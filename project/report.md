### Report Long Description
	- This dashboard contains multiple reports to highlight and visualize the risk in your environment which enables you to ascertain your readiness in terms of data protection in the event of a Ransomware infection.
	- A well protected landscape would mean that data can be recovered with confidence.
	- The dashboard is divided up into sections and each section represents a report.
	- The Risk Mitigation Analysis report in the dashboard describes the risk associated with several key aspects of your protection environment.
	- The report lists servers which are divided across risk categories .
	- For example, the "Sources with No Recent Backups" category lists all servers which have not been backed up in the recent past.
	- The "Suspect Backup by Job Size" category indicates servers whose backup job resulted in a very small size backup which indicates some misconfiguration.  The "Sources Consecutive Failure" category describes the risk of backup jobs failing for certain servers and that means some servers may not be adequately protected.
	- You can click on the donut section of your choice in the chart to get a detailed view of the servers and sources under consideration for that selection.
	- This drill down capability provides deeper insight and helps identify the sources of risk quickly and easily.
	- In order to choose your categories to display, please hover your mouse over the top right part of the report to display icons that let you "edit scope".
	- These rules and categories are also described in Admin ->Solutions->Risk Mitigation.
	- Here you can choose to double click on any rule to customize it for your requirements.
	- You can choose to view multiple categories at the same time or select the categories by clicking on the category legend without changing the scope of the report for quick view and analyze situations.
	- The Risk Mitigation trend report describes the same risk categories spread across time.
	- This report gives you a sense of how your protection risk has been changing over time.  This helps you create a baseline and work towards keeping your risk levels per category below this baseline.
	- The Alerts Summary report describes specific instances when things have not worked as expected with respect to data protection.
	- A NBU primary server connection failure, out of storage condition on the NBU primary server or an incomplete backup job may indicate risk in the environment that needs addressing.
	- The alert summary chart can be used to drill down on any of the alert types to get deeper insight into the source of alert.
	- This helps in mitigating any potential risk in the environment and consequently reducing a potential negative impact of a Ransomware infection.
	- The report scope can be edited by hovering over the top right hand corner of the report and choosing the "Edit Scope" option and choosing which Alert category to see in the report.
	- The alerts can be configured in detail using the top level Alerts tab.
	- The Alert trend report describes the alert occurrences over time.
	- This provides a good way of determining a baseline and staying below the baseline as a goal to mitigate any risk.
	- The "Ransomware File types " report describes the risk associated with the presence of files across the enterprise which have well known ransomware extension names.  This helps to zoom in on servers which have files with potential ransomware infection.
	- This visibility is crucial in identifying the spread of Ransomware infection across the environment.
	- This report provides the summary view of the number of the such file extensions found.
	- You can click on the export icon to download a CSV file which would contain a list of all file paths along with their server locations to help drill down into the source of the infection.
	- This report is available with the "Complete" license pack for NetBackup IT Analytics software.
